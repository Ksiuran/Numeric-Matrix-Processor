# Numeric-Matrix-Processor
Initial commit, Stage 1 of 6 complete.
In stage 2 the program will multiply a matrix by a supplied number. A cli menu to access funtionality from stage one willl be added later.
Matrices are to have their size in (x,y) input initially.

For example matrix F(3,3) that you want multiplied by 3 would be input like:

3 3

1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1

3

and be output like:

3 0 0

0 3 0

0 0 3
