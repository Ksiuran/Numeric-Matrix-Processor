# Numeric-Matrix-Processor
Initial commit, Stage 1 of 6 complete.
In stage 1 the program will add matricies of the same dimention.
Matricies are to have their size in (x,y) input initially.

for example matrix F(3,3) would be input like:

3 3

1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1

and look like:

[[1 0 0]

[0 1 0]

[0 0 1]]
