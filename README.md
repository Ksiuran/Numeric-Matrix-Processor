# Numeric-Matrix-Processor
Stage 3 of 6 complete.
In stage 3 the program has a cli menu to access funtionality from the current stage and previous ones. Program can currently add matrcies, multiply matrcies, and multiply a matrix by a constant.
Matrices are to have their size in (x,y) input initially.

For example matrix F(3,3) would be input like:

3 3

1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1

and be output like:

1 0 0

0 1 0

0 0 1
