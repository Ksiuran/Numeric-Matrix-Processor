# Numeric-Matrix-Processor
Project complete.
The program can currently add matrices, multiply matrices, multiply a matrix by a constant, find the determinant of a matrix, find the inverse of a matrix, and transpose a matrix along the main digaonal, side diagonal, a vertical line, or a horizontal line.
Matrices are to have their size in (x,y) input initially. Project misted as a Medium difficulty.
I am unsure how well this will perform on inverse matrixes above 4x4, I had to finagle a bit to get the signs to work on a 4x4, not sure how my solution will effect 5x5+.

For example matrix F(3,3) would be input like:

3 3

1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1

and be output like:

1 0 0

0 1 0

0 0 1
